### Cubefield
This is pseudo-3D cubefield game written for the course on digital electronics somewhere in
2013. The purpose of the game is to avoid the block that are ahead of the player. The player can also gain points by shooting the blocks in front of him. The score is displayed on the board's LEDs.

## Disclaimer!
*This is horrible VHDL code. The code uses almost 100% of the resources available on the FPGA while
it could've been implemented a lot more efficiently. This is only for educational purposes
though.*
